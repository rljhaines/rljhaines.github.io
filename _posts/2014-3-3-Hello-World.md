Today I set up my GitHub account. I went through the tutorial for creating a repository, a README file, a branch for and edits of said file, and a Pull Request and Merge of the same to update the README of the main branch with the edits made in the readme-edits branch created for this purpose.

I then went to https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/ (where I need to revisit for more information) and forked a copy of jekyll-now to my account. I created and customized my blog site by renaming the repository to rljhaines.github.io and editing the _config.yml file. I gave the file - and thus the blog - my name and city, and I pointed it to the location of my github profile pic. I also change a parameter of the pic to display it double-size on the blog.

Finally, I made this blog entry by editing /_posts/ and updating the Hello World markdown file. I still need to head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
