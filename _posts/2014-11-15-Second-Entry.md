title: 2nd Blog Entry
---

I guess my original post is in 2014-11-15-Hello-World.md, and I'm putting this in
Second-Blog-File.md to see what it does to the Blog site.

So I've learned to include the front-matter block above and to name my posts yyyy-mm-dd-name.md
in order for them to be processed by jekyll, so the above filename did not work for me and this
file is now 2015-11-15-Second-Entry.md. Now to Commit and refresh my blog page!
