title: First vim Blog Entry
---

Blogging from a "blog" alias i set up in ~/.inputrc to vi a file in /User/dickie/Documents/rljhaines.github.io/_posts/`date +%Y-%m-%d`.md. I used the Mac (not MAC, that's Media Access Control) GitHub application to get git to my user directory Documents folder prior to that. I also set my borne shell to use vi through a .bashrc file i found online at github of all places. I will note it soon. I put it in the .inputrc file, however. 

I also found sample .bashrc and .bash_profile (whatever that is) here: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/sample-bashrc.html. I will check them out later.

Ha! it was and .inputrc file and it is here: https://gist.github.com/gregorynicholas/1812027.

Earlier I took a brief look at https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/10 and
am hoping to post this entry with however much ado is required... Hoping not muc
h :-p

Uh oh, now I can't open this file for editing... need to figure that out first!!
! Ah ha! typo in path, trying again!!!

This pushed to github, but did not push through to the blog. For now I hope this modification will allow it to push through (vi Jekyll i believe) to rljhaines.github.io.

Okay, that didn't work. I will give the file a name suffixed to the current date moniker.

Okay, that worked. Did I not read carefully enough to know the naming requirement for Jekyll? Hmmmmm....

Now I will see if these changes I'm now entering into this properly-named post will push through to the blog!

Sure enough!!! git add, commit, push gets the job done :)
