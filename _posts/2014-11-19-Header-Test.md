My earlier From Phone post is missing the frontmatter block but is still getting pushed to the blog, so I will try to push this properly-named file to the blog without the frontmatter block.
It seems the frontmatter is required to keep the individual-page view of the post to 80 characters per line. Surely this is only basic formatting and I will guess that other formatting options would not be available without the frontmatter.
